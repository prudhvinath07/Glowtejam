# Firebase Deployment Plan

This document outlines the steps to deploy the website to Firebase Hosting.

## Overview

The main goal is to get the content of your `index.html` file into the `public` directory that Firebase created and then deploy it.

    subgraph "Local Setup"
        A(Start) --> B{firebase init};
        B -- Creates --> C(public/ directory);
        C --> D[Move your website files into public/];
    end

    subgraph "Deployment"
        D --> E{firebase deploy};
        E -- Publishes to --> F((Firebase Hosting));
    end

    subgraph "Verification"
        F --> G[Verify live website URL];
        G --> H(Done);
    end
```

## Detailed Steps

1.  **Move Website to `public` Directory:** The `firebase init` command created a `public` directory with a default `index.html`. We need to replace that default file with your actual website. We'll move your existing `index.html` into the `public` folder.

2.  **Deploy to Firebase:** Once your file is in the right place, we'll run the `firebase deploy` command. This will upload everything in the `public` folder to Firebase's servers.

3.  **Verify:** After the deployment is complete, you'll get a unique URL (like `glowtejam-aead5.web.app`). We can open this in a browser to see your live website.
